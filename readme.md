### BannerLord Crafting

A collection of quality-of-life improvements for crafting

#### How it works

As of the 1.1.0 official release, the only way to recover crafting stamina is to rest in a settlement.

While I get that traveling and potentially fighting can take it out of your character there are plenty of other activities (such as waiting for nightfall to attack a bandit camp) that I would define as restful.

This mod allows you and your companions to recover at 50% of the normal rate while completing objectives and traveling around Caladria.
